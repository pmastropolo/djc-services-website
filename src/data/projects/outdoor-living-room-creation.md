DJCServices LLC takes outdoor living to the next level! Completed on April 15, 2023, this project saw the transformation of an underutilized backyard into an inviting outdoor living room. We kicked things off by removing an existing, inadequate concrete setup and pouring a fresh slab as the foundation for memorable summer gatherings. Moreover, the driveway expansion and new walking path creation addressed the issue of mud, enhancing overall accessibility. The outcome is an impeccably integrated outdoor space designed for both relaxation and entertainment. Dive into the striking before and after transformations.
